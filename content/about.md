## Hello there aliens !

This is the **Winux kaggle Club** (WinuxDroid).
We are a team of some curious students. We all starts with zero and still improving. We strongly believe in the process of **learning by doing** and that's what we are doing and encouraging others with the techno hack.
Alongside our studies we manage some little things here.

We also focus on the principle: **Make mistakes faster...** Making mistakes is an extensive part of human nature. It is very essential because with making mistakes we learn many new things and gain a fresh experience. But make a mistake only once cuz repeatedly made mistake becomes a habit.

Well you're smart enough...think upon it...

> Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard.
