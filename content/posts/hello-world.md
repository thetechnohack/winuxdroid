## Hello, world!

Traditionally, 'Hello, world!' programs are used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly.

They are usually the first programs that new coders learn, because even those with little or no experience can execute 'Hello, world!' both easily and correctly.

> 'Hello, world!' is usually used as the first example for any programming language.

The 'Hello, world!' program is used to check whether the codes are executing correctly or not.
If 'Hello, world!' does not work effectively within the framework, then it is likely that other, more complex programs will also fail.

## History

!['Hello, World!' program by Brian Kernighan (1978)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg/220px-Hello_World_Brian_Kernighan_1978.jpg)

Though the origins of Hello World remain somewhat unclear, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition/page/n143/mode/2up">The C Programming Language</a>.

The example program in that book prints "Hello, world!", and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by **Brian Kernighan**, Programming in C: A Tutorial.

## 'Hello, world! ' in different programming languages

Here’s what the code for Hello World looks like in some of the most popular programming languages currently in use.

### Python 3

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Java

```java
class HelloWorld {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
}
}
```

### C#

```c#
using System;
class Program
{
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
}
}
```

### Ruby

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```

### Scala

```scala
object HelloWorld extends App {
println("Hello, world!")
}
```

With the increasing complexity of modern coding languages, Hello World is more important than ever. Both as a test and a teaching tool, it has become a standardized way of allowing programmers to configure their environment.

No one can be sure why Hello World has stood the test of time in an industry known for rapid-fire innovation, but it is here to stay.

By the way, in which program language you have written your first 'Hello, world!' program. Mine was `helloworld.py`.
