If you always hesitate to install different software packages on your local system â€” this blog is for you.

Yes, the best solution to this problem is a cloud based environment.

The cloud computing market is pretty huge but we are going to talk about **Google Cloud Platform(GCP)**, more specifically about Google Cloud Shell.

GCP is a very big deal that's why we are just focusing on cloud shell for now.

## What is Google Cloud Shell ?

Cloud Shell is an online development environment based on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

It runs on a Debian-Based virtual machine, that can be accessed with any browser, it makes it easy to manage your projects and resources without having to install them on your local system.
